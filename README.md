# ChatGPT-exploration
In this repo, I will be exploring and codes that can help org/individual to work with chatGPT for larger benifit. This depends on **Azure Open AI** access. Hence, I will request to opt for free credential to leverage if do not have access. 

## Topics:

1. **Dataset Generator**.
  With contextual understanding of most of the domains, it is benificial to generate mock/synthetic data for building quick POCs. In general, without domain knowledge it extremely difficult to generate data that looks closer to real data. This can be still done using some rule/logic but these cases have a lot of limitation.
